                    <h3>AP Literature</h3>
                    <p>I take AP Literature, and we work a lot in groups with social skills but also learning about how to speak in a work environment.</p>

                    <h3>AP Calculus</h3>
                    <p>AP Calculus is helping me prepare for what I want to do in college and as a career. I really enjoy math and coming up with new ideas and projects.</p>

                    <h3>Economics</h3>
                    <p>Economics is a cooldown period for me, I really enjoy it and I absolutely adore the stock market and all different methods of investment, to make sure I have a solid retirement and capital.</p>

                <h2>Why I'm in Computer Science</h2>
                <p>
                    I love solving problems, whether it's puzzle games or why a cord doesn't work. I find that school comes easy to me so when I do get a challenge it's nice to be able to test myself and my intelect. I enjoy hand on learning much more as well, and seeing what I've done and knowing I made it, which is why I love CS, I can make my own program and have it do whatever I want.
