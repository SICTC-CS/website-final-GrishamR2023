                <h2>My Experiences</h2>
    
                <p>
                    My name is Rece Grisham, I am a student at Evansville North Highschool and the Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center. I've been surrounded by electronics since I was little. When I was young I would take apart old phones that were broken to see the insides and figure out how they worked.
                    Once I was old enough to have my first laptop, I instantly fell in love, constantly learning everything I could about it and figuring out how to customize and optimize it for me.
                    When I got into highschool, I finally got a desktop, I built it myself and I was so captivated by it at that point I knew I wanted computers to be a part of my career in some form. Now, my interest has only
                    grown and I find myself just watching youtube videos about different technology and making myself more educated in the computer and technology field. I'm definitely the most tech-savvy person in my
                    family, often getting calls to fix something as easy as the internet to a broken printer. I love solving problems and get a sense of accomplishment any time I fix a device.
